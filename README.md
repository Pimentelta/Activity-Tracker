# Activity-Tracker
Software for an Activity Tracker, involving proper documentation, and design.

Make sure to download a local zip of the project. Then proceed to import the project into Eclipse. 
Once imported successfully, make sure to have:
*Java Version 1.8 SE
*JavaFX
*Scenebuilder 2.0

Simply run the project by pressing the play button at the top of the eclipse window.

How the project is working:
Main Menu is the first screen viewed, which gives the user the time based on the system. 
From the Main Menu the user may view how many steps they have taken, heartrate in bpm, and calories burned using simulated data by selecting "View Data". 
The user may want to change the time to their time zone by selecting "Change Time"
The user can increase or decrease how many steps they need for their goal by selecting "New Goal". Currently this feature only works for Steps as a goal, Calories as a goal is still in development. 
The user can view their sleeping habits by selecting "Sleep" the simulated system assumes your heartbeat changes every second. 
The user can start a new session where they can change their age, height, and weight within "New Session" in order to better represent how many calories they are burning.
The final menu option "Live Graph" is supposed to show how many steps have been taken on a graph using simulated data however, the results do not appear to be graphed.
